# Feature Updates - March 2025

This document details the recent feature updates to the Analytics Chatbot.

## 1. Statistical Operations on Ratios

### Overview
The chatbot now supports performing statistical operations (like average, median, etc.) on ratio calculations. This allows for more complex analytical queries that combine both ratio calculations and statistical analysis.

### Example Queries
- "What is the average ratio of Product Inventory to Order Confirmation?"
- "Calculate the median ratio of visits to order confirmations"
- "What's the standard deviation of the ratio between credit card additions and visits?"

### Technical Implementation
- Added a new operation type `statistical_ratio` in the NLP service
- Enhanced the query processor to first calculate ratios for each item, then perform statistical operations on those ratio values
- Improved pattern matching for ratio terms in complex queries

### Before vs After
**Before**: When asking "what is the average ratio of Product Inventory to Order Confirmation", the system would only return the average of Product Inventory Page Visits.

**After**: The system now correctly calculates the ratio for each sales rep first, then computes the average of those ratios.

## 2. Query Interpretation Display

### Overview
The chatbot now shows a clear interpretation of how it understood your query, making the system more transparent and helping users understand why they might be getting certain results.

### Benefits
- Verify the system correctly understood your intent
- Understand why you might be getting unexpected results
- Learn how to phrase queries more effectively

### Technical Implementation
- Added a query interpretation generator in the query processor
- Enhanced the API response to include the interpretation
- Updated the frontend to display the interpretation with improved styling

### Example
When you ask "What is the average ratio of order confirmations to visits?", the system will display:
```
I understood you wanted to get metrics with mean of the ratio of Order Confirmations to Total Visits across the whole dataset
```

## Other Potential Improvements

### Confidence Scoring
- Implement a confidence score for query interpretations
- High confidence: Proceed with the query as interpreted
- Medium confidence: Show interpretation but ask for confirmation
- Low confidence: Ask for clarification before proceeding

### Suggested Query Refinements
When the system detects ambiguity or has low confidence:
```
I'm not sure if you wanted:
1. The average of Product Inventory Page Visits
2. The average ratio of Product Inventory to Order Confirmations
3. Something else?
```

### Enhanced Metric Recognition
- Handle abbreviations (e.g., "PI" for "Product Inventory")
- Support synonyms (e.g., "sales" for "order confirmations")
- Recognize metrics even when mentioned with typos

### Query Templates
Add a "suggested queries" section that shows examples of complex queries the system can handle:
```
Try these advanced queries:
- "What's the average ratio of X to Y?"
- "Compare the top 5 and bottom 5 reps by X"
- "Show me the correlation between X and Y"
```
